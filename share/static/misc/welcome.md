How to use
----------

The toolbar at the top has the main controls,
while the right toolbar is for dynamic content (pyramids).

**galacteek** uses different workspaces:

- **Files**: this workspace is for things related to
file management, import, sharing, and browsing (using
the UnixFS browser). The filemanager allows you to import
files in the IPFS repository from your local filesystem.
For sharing files, check out the
[filesharing page in the manual](manual:/filesharing.html).

- **Earth** workspace: dedicated to browsing. All content
tagged with @Earth is automatically opened here.

- **Messenger** workspace: allows you to send messages with the
BitMessage protocol.

- **Peers**: lists the peers you're connected with, and contains
tools to communicate, like the encrypted chat and the Atom
feeds reader

- **Search**: this workspace is dedicated to searching content
on the dweb.

- **Editing**: from this workspace you can edit files and write
blog posts

- **Multimedia**: workspace for the multimedia player
