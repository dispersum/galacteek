Application settings
====================

The **Edit** -> **Settings** dialog lets you change the application settings.

IPFS settings
-------------

The application can either spawn a local IPFS daemon (this is the default) or let
you use an IPFS daemon to which you already have access. You need to restart
the application after accepting the new settings.

**Note**: changing these settings will make you lose access to the content
that you might have published using the previous settings.

User interface settings
-----------------------

Hide hashes
^^^^^^^^^^^

This will hide the IPFS hashes wherever possible (file manager, ipfs views..)

Wrap single files or directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If enabled, files or directories will be wrapped within a directory object
(.dirw)
