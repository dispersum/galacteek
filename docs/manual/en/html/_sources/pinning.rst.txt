Pinning content
===============

The concept of pinning is a fundamental core feature of IPFS. By pinning a
given resource to your node, you start serving that content to the
network, increasing its availability and resilience.

Pinning manually in the browser
-------------------------------

Within a browsing tab, you can manually pin a page with the **PIN** combobox, which
allows single or recursive pinning. You will get a system tray notification when
the pinning is complete.

Automatic pinning
-----------------

You can also activate the automatic pinning with the **Automatic PIN** switch
button. When it's activated, all pages visited in this browsing session will be
automatically pinned to your IPFS node.

At the top-right corner of the window, next to the clipboard loader's icon,
another switch button activates application-wide automatic pinning (automatic
pinning for all new browsing sessions).

Pinning status
--------------

In the status bar (at the bottom of the window), the pinning status icon gives
information about the status of the pinning system. Clicking on it gives a view of
the objects being pinned.
