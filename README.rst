**galacteek** is a multi-platform Qt5-based browser/toolbox
for the IPFS_ peer-to-peer network.

Installation
============

* **AppImage (Linux)**: `Galacteek-0.4.21-x86_64.AppImage <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.21/Galacteek-0.4.21-x86_64.AppImage>`_
* **DMG (MacOS)**: `Galacteek-0.4.21.dmg <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.21/Galacteek-0.4.21.dmg>`_

*MacOS notes*: After opening/mounting the DMG image, hold Control and click on the
**galacteek** icon, and select **Open** and accept. You probably need to
allow the system to install applications *from anywhere* in the security
settings.

See the releases_ page for all releases.

Command-line usage
==================

Use the *-d* command-line switch to enable debugging output. Using *--profile* gives
you the ability to have separate application profiles (*main* is the default
profile). Use *--help* for all options.

Enable colorized log output with **--log-color**

Use the **--no-ipfsscheme-mutex** switch to disable mutexes in the native IPFS scheme
handler.

*Development*: Use *--monitor* to enable event-loop monitoring with aiomonitor_
(install aiomonitor_ manually as it's not a dependency).
Then connect to the aiomonitor_ interface with **nc localhost 50101**

Features
========

**galacteek** can either spawn an IPFS daemon and use it as transport, or
connect to an existing IPFS daemon. By default it will try to run a daemon. You
can change the IPFS connection settings by clicking on the settings icon in the
toolbar and restart the application afterwards. If using a custom daemon, you
should enable pubsub and p2p streams, or some features won't be available.

- Decentralized Identifiers (DID) support with IPID_
- Browser-to-browser DID authentication over libp2p streams
  (Verifiable Credentials with RSA-PSS)
- Browsing sessions with automatic pinning (pins every page you browse)
- Distributed chat with pubsub (chat channels syncronized with CRDT+DAG)
- File manager with drag-and-drop support
- Run WASM binaries with wasmer_ (use *Open* on a WASM object from the
  clipboard manager)
- Search content with the ipfs-search_ search engine
- Atom feeds (subscribe to feeds on the dweb)
- ENS_ (Ethereum Name Service) resolving (access to ENS+IPFS websites)
- Basic built-in media player with IPFS-stored playlists
- Image viewer
- QR codes from images

Keyboard shortcuts
==================

Please see the shortcuts_ page (or from the application, click on the
Information icon in the toolbar, which will open the documentation).
