About
=====

*Galacteek* is an experimental browser for the IPFS_ peer-to-peer network,
written in Python_ with the Qt_ GUI framework. The goal is to provide a
simple interface for publishing and accessing content over IPFS_, accessible to
most users.

As of version *0.1.5*, the featureset is still minimal but it allows importing
files, browsing, publishing content to IPNS keys, hashmarking, pinning, playing
multimedia content ..
