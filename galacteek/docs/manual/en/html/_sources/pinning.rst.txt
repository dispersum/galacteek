Pinning content
===============

The concept of pinning is a fundamental core feature of IPFS. By pinning a
given resource to your node, you start serving that content to the
network, increasing its availability and resilience.

Pinning manually in the browser
-------------------------------

Within a browsing tab, you can manually pin a page with the **PIN** tool button
at the far right, which allows single or recursive pinning. You will get a
system tray notification when the pinning is complete.

Automatic pinning
-----------------

You can also activate the automatic pinning with the **Automatic PIN** switch
button. When it's activated, all pages visited in this browsing session will be
automatically pinned to your IPFS node.

In the application's toolbar, next to the clipboard manager,
another switch button activates application-wide automatic pinning.

Pinning status
--------------

In the status bar (at the bottom of the window), the pinning status icon gives
information about the status of the pinning queues. Clicking on it gives a view of
the objects being pinned.
